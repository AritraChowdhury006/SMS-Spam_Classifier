# 📧 SMS & Email Spam Classifier

This repository showcases a fully developed machine learning project focused on detecting spam messages in both SMS and email formats. Built in PyCharm using the UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset, the project guides users through the complete ML pipeline — from raw text to real-time classification.

## ⚙ Project Highlights

- 🔍 Data Exploration: Conducted in Jupyter Notebook for initial insights
- 🧼 Data Cleaning: Removal of noise, duplicates, and irrelevant entries
- 📊 EDA: Visualization and statistical analysis of spam vs ham patterns
- 🧠 Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stemming, stopwords removal
- 🔤 TF-IDF Vectorization: For converting text into model-ready features
- 🤖 Model Building: Implemented Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression & others
- 📈 Performance Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning & metric evaluation
- 💻 PyCharm Workflow: Local development and testing environment
- 🌐 Heroku Deployment: Cloud-based real-time spam detection
